# Trees-Graphs
Problems involving Trees,Tries, and Graphs

### 1. Minimal Tree
Given a sorted array (increasing order) with unique integers, create a binary search tree with minimal height

### 2. List of Depths
Create a linkedlist for each depth of a linked list

### 3. Check Balanced
Check if a binary tree is balanced, balanced is defined as a tree where the heights of the two subtrees don't differ by more than one

### 4. Check BST
Confirm that a binary tree is  a BST

### 5. Successor
Find the next node in an In-order traversal of the tree

### 6. First Common Ancestor
Find lowest common ancestor. Using both parent links on the nodes and without parent links

### 7. BST Sequence
Given a BST, print all possible arrays that could have lead to this BST

### 8. Check Subtree
Check if a  T2 exists within another tree T1

### 9. Paths with Sum
Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. Path must go downwards
