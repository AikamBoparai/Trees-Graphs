# Trees-Graphs
Problems involving Trees,Tries, and Graphs

### 1. Minimal Tree
Given a sorted array (increasing order) with unique integers, create a binary search tree with minimal height

### 2. List of Depths
Create a linkedlist for each depth of a linked list

### 3. Check Balanced
Check if a binary tree is balanced, balanced is defined as a tree where the heights of the two subtrees don't differ by more than one

### 4. Check BST
Confirm that a binary tree is  a BST

### 5. Successor
Find the next node in an In-order traversal of the tree
